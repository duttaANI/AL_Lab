### 1. Floyds Algo {Fails when there are negative weight cycles}

**All Pair shortest Path Algorithm** __for directional weighted graph as adj matrix__ 
gives shortest path between two nodes of graph

### 2. Bellman Ford Algo {Fails when there are negative weight cycles}
       It is single source shortest path algo . It is capable of handling negative weights whereas dijkstra can not handle negative weights.

### 3. Warshall Algo

Transitive closure of a graph. Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex j is reachable from another vertex i for all vertex pairs (i, j) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is a path from vertex i to j. The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph.
