### Floyds Algo 

**All Pair shortest Path Algorithm** __for directional weighted graph as adj matrix__ 
gives shortest path between two nodes of graph

### Warshall Algo

Transitive closure of a graph. Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex j is reachable from another vertex i for all vertex pairs (i, j) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is a path from vertex i to j. The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph.
